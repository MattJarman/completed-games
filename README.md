![Production](https://github.com/MattJarman/completed-games/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

# ðŸš€ Quick Start

## 1. Clone

```sh
https://github.com/MattJarman/completed-games.git
```

## 2. Install

```sh
(cd completed-games && pnpm i)
```

## 3. Secrets

This project uses [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) for its content, so all content models
will need to be implemented. Once done, you can copy the `.env.local.example` to `.env` and fill in
the environment variables for your Contentful space.

```sh
cp .env.local.example .env
```

## 4. Start

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

The site should now be accessible on `localhost:3000`.
